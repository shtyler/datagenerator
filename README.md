<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Problem ### 
* Missing data with nearly every customer implementation. Why?
  * Security reasons
  * Development time on customer side 
  * Integration issues 
  * Development of custom connector in GD
* Precious time spent on DDL scripts + whatever ad hoc data generation => problems with referential integrity
* Professional services can jump right on the solution without any blockers

### Solution ### 
* Let’s use just LDM to generate data
* LDM.json has all necessary information to generate mockup data
* LDM can be built quickly and it is (usually) starting point for each project
* LDM.json file can be downloaded and used in SQL executor as list of parameters for .liquid template
* In other words: Match made in heaven


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
1. Clone this git repo
2. Update `datagen/param_definitions/LDM.json` with your freshly created LDM from the WEB modeler (/admin/modeler/#/projects/{pid}). WARNING: LDM.json must be in ASCII encoding.
3. Load the `datagen` folder to your S3 bucket
4. Set up your output stage (OS) prefix (default is `out_generated_vw_`) 
5. (Optional) Change default OS prefix in all 3 liquid templates `{%-assign out_prefix = "out_generated_vw_" -%}`
6. (Optional) Load custom input to the table `generated_custom_values (dataset VARCHAR, field VARCHAR, values VARCHAR)`. See Example 3.
7. Deploy & Run SQL executor to trigger `00_create_functions.sql` and `01_run_datagen.sql`
8. Schedule & Run ADD to upload data to WS



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Example 1 - Creating the output stage.
Sometimes all you need is to create an output stage according to the model. OS consists of out_ tables and out_vw_ views on top of the out_ tables. 
If that is the case all you need to run is **1_generate_os.liquid**. Update the 01_run_datagen.sql to run only this template - leave only first row - and you are good to go.
By running the script you will generate OS.

### Example 2 - Creating the output stage and populating it with mockup data.
Mockup data are generated under simple principles with respect to referential integrity. By default, number of records in dimension table, fact table and number of random values in attributes are set to certain values. 
These can be changed in the template. Date values are always generated within previous 300 days. To run mockup data generation you need to run generate OS and **2_populate_os.liquid** template. Adjust 01_run_datagen.sql accordingly.

### Example 3 - Creating the output stage, populating it with mockup data and updating it with custom values.
If you need to use your custom values in the attributes or facts you can load them to `generated_custom_values` table with following structure (dataset, field, values) by using copy command. Table will be automatically created during the first run of SQL Executor or you can create it before. Then you can either update the table manually or copy command the values into it from CSV.  
`dataset` and `field` have to match values in the LDM (last part of the identifier). In `values` you can use either list of values separated by comma (`,`), e.g. "Plzeň, Matuška, Konrád".
or range of numeric values separated by dash (`-`), e.g. "1 - 50". Real values for the particular field will be generated randomly from the given list or range. 
_The solution does not yet support custom values for dates, connection points and references._
To run update with custom values you need to run generate OS, populate OS and **3_update_os.liquid**. Adjust 01_run_datagen.sql accordingly.

## Run on Local
If you don't want to set up the SQL Executor to generate the code you can render the templates on the local machine using Ruby. 
Update the `datagen/param_definitions/LDM.json` with your LDM, update the script `run_local.rb` to render required template and then simply run the script `jruby run_local.rb`. It will generate the SQL which you can then use in the ADS.
